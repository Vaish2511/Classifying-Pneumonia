A Python-based application classifying chest X-rays into healthy vs. affected lungs. Developed with a three-member team, the model accounts for class imbalance using GANs to generate a balanced sub-dataset. Achieved 88% accuracy, 13% higher than the original model, using real-time data from an X-ray firm.
