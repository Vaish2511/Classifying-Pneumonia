# Classifying-Pneumonias-using-Chest-X-Rays

## Description:
A Python-based application classifying chest X-rays into healthy vs. affected lungs. Developed with a three-member team, the model accounts for class imbalance using GANs to generate a balanced sub-dataset. Achieved 88% accuracy, 13% higher than the original model, using real-time data from an X-ray firm.

## Key Features:
1. Chest X-ray Classification: Use machine learning models to classify X-ray images into healthy (vanilla) and affected lungs.
2. Class Imbalance Handling: Address class imbalance by generating a balanced sub-dataset using GANs, improving model accuracy.
3. Real-time Data Integration: Leverage real-time chest X-ray data from a collaboration with an X-ray firm for training.

## Data Sources:
1. Ghuangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, China
2. MIOT International Hospitals, India

## Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Libraries (TensorFlow, Scikit - Learn)
3. Data-Processing Libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
4. Image Processing Libraries (ImageDataGenerator)

## Target-Audience:
1. Medical researchers and scientists working in the field of healthcare and medical imaging.
2. Developers focused on AI and machine learning applications in the healthcare sector.
3. Healthcare professionals and organizations aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and early detection of lung diseases.

## Why it Matters: 
This project plays a crucial role in the early detection of lung diseases, such as pneumonia, through automated chest X-ray classification. By leveraging machine learning and addressing class imbalance using GANs, it provides a more accurate and scalable solution for identifying affected lungs, which can aid healthcare professionals in making quicker, more accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
